    text-align: justify;">Once a small Japanese fishing village and later a Russian penal colony, Korsakov is now a melting pot of Japanese, Korean and Russian cultures located on Sakhalin Island, just north of Japan and east of mainland Russia. Though its tumultuous history includes power struggles and forced labor, the town is the perfect picture of tranquility today. if you’re interested in Korsakov’s past, you can admire the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Resurrection, a popular tourist destination.</p></p>
